     <h1>Professor Reep</h1>
     <h2> Course description: </h2>
     <p>This course teaches survey of the art of music encompassing a variety of music styles and historical eras in both the western and non-western world.</p>
     <h2> Professor Reep's bio/interests: </h2>
     <p> Professor Reep is the assistant Director of Athletic Bands at Virginia Tech. He earned his Masters of Music in Wind Conducting at James Madison University.</p>
     <h2> Overview: </h2>
     <p> I've enjoyed this class because I played the cello for 7 years and it has been nice to find a way to continue enjoying and keeping up with music. It's been interesting learning about different types of music this semester compared to the Theory/Fundamentals class I took last year.</p>
