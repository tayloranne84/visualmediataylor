     <h1>Dr. Evia</h1>
     <h2> Course description: </h2>
     <p>Visual Media is the introduction to the visual image and visual thinking applied to photography, video, and film.</p>
     <h2> Dr. Evia's bio/interests: </h2>
     <p> Whenever Dr. Evia is not trying to find chicken recipes, he's hanging out with his adorable daughter. He has written many articles, a book, and been a part of sponsored research. He has a PhD from Texas Tech University and specializes in content strategy and technical and professional communication. </p>
     <h2> Overview: </h2>
     <p> I believe this class is very helpful and Dr. Evia has done an amazing job in making a basic skills class exciting. Visual media would not be the same without his jokes. Although he loves to joke around, he is very serious about everyone getting their work done to the best of their ability. If I could, I would definitely take this class again! </p>
